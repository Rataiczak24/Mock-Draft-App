# Quick Note

Due to the lack of available APIs, I used ParseHub to scrape the data from a website which created my own API to use. If the data does not display, it is most likely a CORS policy issue. As a simple temporary fix, you can use the [Moesif Origin & CORS Changer extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=en-US) on Google Chrome and enable it for the webpage.
